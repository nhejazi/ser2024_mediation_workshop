## Controlled direct effects

$$\psi_{\text{CDE}} = \E(Y_{1,m} - Y_{0,m})$$

![](img/graphic4a3.png){width=40%}

- Set the mediator to a reference value $M=m$ uniformly for everyone in the
  population
- Compare $A=1$ vs $A=0$ with $M=m$ fixed

### Identification assumptions:
- Confounder assumptions:
  + $A \indep Y_{a,m} \mid W$
  + $M \indep Y_{a,m} \mid W, A$
- Positivity assumptions:
  + $\P(M = m \mid A=a, W) > 0 \text{  } a.e.$
  + $\P(A=a \mid W) > 0 \text{  } a.e.$

Under the above identification assumptions, the controlled direct effect can be
identified:
$$
  \E(Y_{1,m} - Y_{0,m}) = \E\{ \color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=1, M=m, W) -
    \E(Y \mid A=0, M=m, W)} \}
$$

- For intuition about this formula in R, let's continue with a toy example:
  ```{webr-r}
  n <- 1e6
  w <- rnorm(n)
  a <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
  m <- rnorm(n, w + a)
  y <- rnorm(n, w + a + m)
  ```
- First we fit a correct model for the outcome
  ```{webr-r}
  lm_y <- lm(y ~ m + a + w)
  ```
- Assume we would like the CDE at $m=0$
- Then we generate predictions
  $$
    \color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=1, M=m, W)} \text{ and }
      \color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=0, M=m, W)} \ :
  $$
  ```{webr-r}
  pred_y1 <- predict(lm_y, newdata = data.frame(a = 1, m = 0, w = w))
  pred_y0 <- predict(lm_y, newdata = data.frame(a = 0, m = 0, w = w))
  ```
- Then we compute the difference between the predicted values
  $\color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=1, M=m, W) - \E(Y \mid A=0, M=m, W)}$, and
  average across values of $W$
  ```{webr-r}
  ## CDE at m = 0
  mean(pred_y1 - pred_y0)
  ```

### Is this the estimand I want?

+ Makes the most sense if can intervene directly on $M$
  + And can think of a policy that would set everyone to a constant level $m
    \in \mathcal{M}$.
  + Judea Pearl calls this *prescriptive*.
  + Can you think of an example? (Air pollution, rescue inhaler dosage,
    hospital visits...)
  + Does not provide a decomposition of the average treatment effect into
    direct and indirect effects.

*What if our research question doesn't involve intervening directly on the
mediator?*

*What if we want to decompose the average treatment effect into its direct and
indirect counterparts?*

## Natural direct and indirect effects

Still using the same DAG as above,

- Recall the definition of the nested counterfactual:
  \begin{equation*}
    Y_{1, M_0} = f_Y(W, 1, M_0, U_Y)
  \end{equation*}

- Interpreted as _the outcome for an individual in a hypothetical world where
  treatment was given but the mediator was held at the value it would have
  taken under no treatment_

  ![](img/graphic4a.png){width=40%}

- Recall that, because of the definition of counterfactuals
  \begin{equation*}
    Y_{1, M_1} = Y_1
  \end{equation*}

Then we can decompose the _average treatment effect_ $\E(Y_1-Y_0)$ as follows

\begin{equation*}
\E[Y_{1,M_1} - Y_{0,M_0}] = \underbrace{\E[Y_{\color{red}{1},\color{blue}{M_1}}
  - Y_{\color{red}{1},\color{blue}{M_0}}]}_{\text{natural indirect effect}} +
  \underbrace{\E[Y_{\color{blue}{1},\color{red}{M_0}} -
  Y_{\color{blue}{0},\color{red}{M_0}}]}_{\text{natural direct effect}}
\end{equation*}

- Natural direct effect (NDE): Varying treatment while keeping the mediator
  fixed at the value it would have taken under no treatment
- Natural indirect effect (NIE): Varying the mediator from the value it would
  have taken under treatment to the value it would have taken under control,
  while keeping treatment fixed

### Identification assumptions:

- $A \indep Y_{a,m} \mid W$
- $M \indep Y_{a,m} \mid W, A$
- $A \indep M_a \mid W$
- $M_0 \indep Y_{1,m} \mid W$
- and positivity assumptions

### Cross-world independence assumption

What does $M_0 \indep Y_{1,m} \mid W$ mean?

- Conditional on $W$, knowledge of the mediator value in the absence of
  treatment, $M_0$,
  provides no information about the outcome under treatment, $Y_{1,m}$.
- Can you think of a data-generating mechanism that would violate this
  assumption?
- Example: in a randomized study, whenever we believe that treatment assignment
  works through adherence (i.e., almost
  always), we are violating this assumption (more on this later).
- Cross-world assumptions are problematic for other reasons, including:
  - You can never design a randomized study where the assumption holds by
    design.

**If the cross-world assumption holds, can write the NDE as a weighted average
of controlled direct effects at each level of $M=m$.**

$$
  \E \sum_m \{\E(Y_{1,m} \mid W) - \E(Y_{0,m} \mid W)\} \P(M_{0}=m \mid W)
$$

- If CDE($m$) is constant across $m$, then CDE = NDE.

### Identification formula:

- Under the above identification assumptions, the natural direct effect can be
  identified:
  \begin{equation*}
    \E(Y_{1,M_0} - Y_{0,M_0}) =
    \E[\color{Goldenrod}{\E\{}\color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=1, M, W) -
    \E(Y \mid A=0, M, W)}\color{Goldenrod}{\mid A=0,W\}}]
  \end{equation*}

- The natural indirect effect can be identified similarly.
- Let's dissect this formula in `R`:
  ```{webr-r}
  n <- 1e6
  w <- rnorm(n)
  a <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
  m <- rnorm(n, w + a)
  y <- rnorm(n, w + a + m)
  ```
- First we fit a correct model for the outcome
  ```{webr-r}
  lm_y <- lm(y ~ m + a + w)
  ```

- Then we generate predictions $\color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=1, M, W)}
  \text{ and }\color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=0, M, W)}$ with $A$ fixed but
  letting $M$ and $W$ take their observed values
  ```{webr-r}
  pred_y1 <- predict(lm_y, newdata = data.frame(a = 1, m = m, w = w))
  pred_y0 <- predict(lm_y, newdata = data.frame(a = 0, m = m, w = w))
  ```
- Then we compute the difference between the predicted values
  $\color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=1, M, W) - \E(Y \mid A=0, M, W)},$
- and use this difference as a pseudo-outcome in a regression on $A$ and $W$:
  $\color{Goldenrod}{\E\{}\color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=1, M, W) - \E(Y \mid
  A=0, M, W)}\color{Goldenrod}{\mid A=0,W\}}$
  ```{webr-r}
  pseudo <- pred_y1 - pred_y0
  lm_pseudo <- lm(pseudo ~ a + w)
  ```

- Now we predict the value of this pseudo-outcome under $A=0$, and average the
  result
  ```{webr-r}
  pred_pseudo <- predict(lm_pseudo, newdata = data.frame(a = 0, w = w))

  ## NDE:
  mean(pred_pseudo)
  ```

### Is this the estimand I want?

- Makes sense to intervene on $A$ but not directly on $M$.
- Want to understand a natural mechanism underlying an association / total
  effect. J. Pearl calls this _descriptive_.
- NDE + NIE = total effect (ATE).
- Okay with the assumptions.

_What if our data structure involves a post-treatment confounder of the
mediator-outcome relationship (e.g., adherence)?_

### Unidentifiability of the NDE and NIE in this setting

- In this example, natural direct and indirect effects are not generally point
  identified from observed data $O=(W,A,Z,M,Y)$.
- The reason for this is that the cross-world counterfactual
  assumption
  $$
    Y_{1,m} \indep M_0 \mid W
  $$
  does not hold in the above directed acyclic graph.

- To give intuition, we focus on the counterfactual outcome $Y_{A=1, M_{A=0}}$.
  - This counterfactual outcome involves two counterfactual worlds
    simultaneously: one in which $A=1$ for the first portion of the
    counterfactual outcome, and one in which $A=0$ for the nested portion of the
    counterfactual outcome.
  - Setting $A=1$ induces a counterfactual treatment-induced confounder, denoted
    $Z_{A=1}$. Setting $A=0$ induces another counterfactual treatment-induced
    confounder, denoted $Z_{A=0}$.
  - The two treatment-induced counterfactual confounders, $Z_{A=1}$ and
    $Z_{A=0}$ share unmeasured common causes, $U_Z$, which creates a spurious
    association.
  - Because $Z_{A=1}$ is causally related to $Y_{A=1, M=m}$, and $Z_{A=0}$ is
    also casually related to $M_{A=0}$, the path through $U_Z$ means that the
    backdoor criterion is not met for identification of $Y_{A=1, M_{A=0}}$,
    i.e., $M_{0} \notindep Y_{A=1, m} \mid W$, where $W$ denotes
    baseline covariates.

<!--
this is what we used to have
- Technically, the reason for this is that an intervention setting $A=1$
  (necessary for the definition of $Y_{1,m}$) induces a counterfactual variable
  $Z_1$.
- Likewise, an intervention setting $A=0$ (necessary for the definition of
  $M_0$) induces a counterfactual $Z_0$.
- The variables $Z_1$ and $Z_0$ are correlated because they share unmeasured
  common causes, $U_Z$.
- The variable $Z_1$ is correlated with $Y_{1,m}$, and the variable $Z_0$ is
  correlated with $M_0$, because they are counterfactual outcomes in the same
  hypothetical worlds.
- To see this in the definition of counterfactual from a causal structural
  model:
\begin{align*}
  Y_{1,m} &= f_Y(W, 1, Z_1, m, U_Y), \text{ and }\\
  M_0 &= f_M(W, 0, Z_0, U_M)\\
\end{align*}
are correlated even after adjusting for $W$ by virtue of $Z_1$ and $Z_0$ being
correlated.
-->

<!--
Intuitively:
- $Z$ is a confounder of the relation $M \rightarrow Y$, which requires
  adjustment
- But $Z$ is on the pathway $A\rightarrow Y$, which precludes adjustment
-->

However:

- We can actually actually identify the NIE/NDE in the above setting if we are
  willing to invoke monotonicity between a treatment and one or more binary
  treatment-induced confounders [@tchetgen2014identification].
- Assuming monotonicity is also sometimes referred to as assuming "no defiers"
  -- in other words, assuming that there are no individuals who would do the
  opposite of the encouragement.
- Monotonicity may seem like a restrictive assumption, but may be reasonable in
  some common scenarios (e.g., in trials where the intervention is randomized
  treatment assignment and the treatment-induced confounder is whether or not
  treatment was actually taken -- in this setting, we may feel comfortable
  assuming that there are no "defiers", frequently assumed when using IVs to
  identify causal effects)

Note: CDEs are still identified in this setting. They can be identified and
estimated similarly to a longitudinal data sructure with a two-time-point
intervention.

## Interventional (in)direct effects

- Let $G_a$ denote a random draw from the distribution of $M_a \mid W$
- Define the counterfactual $Y_{1,G_0}$ as the counterfactual
  variable in a hypothetical world where $A$ is set $A=1$ and $M$ is
  set to $M=G_0$ with probability one.

![](img/graphic4b.png){width=60%}

- Define $Y_{0,G_0}$ and $Y_{1,G_1}$ similarly
- Then we can define:
  $$
    \E[Y_{1,G_1} - Y_{0,G_0}] = \underbrace{\E[Y_{\color{red}{1},
      \color{blue}{G_1}} - Y_{\color{red}{1},
      \color{blue}{G_0}}]}_{\text{interventional indirect effect}} +
      \underbrace{\E[Y_{\color{blue}{1},\color{red}{G_0}} -
      Y_{\color{blue}{0},
      \color{red}{G_0}}]}_{\text{interventional direct effect}}
  $$

- Note that $\E[Y_{1,G_1} - Y_{0,G_0}]$ is still a _total effect_ of treatment,
  even if it is different from the ATE $\E[Y_{1} - Y_{0}]$
- We gain in the ability to solve a problem, but lose in terms of interpretation
  of the causal effect (cannot decompose the ATE)

### An alternative definition of the effects:

- Above  we defined $G_a$ as a random draw from the distribution of $M_a \mid W$
- What if instead we define $G_a$ as a random draw from the distribution of $M_a
  \mid (Z_a,W)$
- It turns out the indirect effect defined in this way only measures the path
  $A\rightarrow M \rightarrow Y$, and not the path $A\rightarrow Z\rightarrow M
  \rightarrow Y$
- There may be important reasons to choose one over another (e.g., survival
  analyses where we want the distribution conditional on $Z$, instrumental
  variable designs where it doesn't make sense to condition on $Z$)

<!--
 + Marginal PIDE: $\E(Y_{a, g_{M \mid a^{\star}, W}}) -
   \E(Y_{a^{\star}, g_{M \mid a^{\star}, W}})$
 + Marginal PIIE: $\E(Y_{a, g_{M \mid a, W}}) -
   \E(Y_{a, g_{M \mid a^{\star}, W}})$
 + Conditional PIDE: $\E(Y_{a, g_{M \mid Z, a^{\star}, W}}) -
   \E(Y_{a^{\star}, g_{M \mid Z, a^{\star}, W}})$
 + Conditional PIIE: $\E(Y_{a, g_{M \mid Z, a, W}}) -
   \E(Y_{a, g_{M \mid Z, a^{\star}, W}})$
 + Can you think of an example when you would want the conditional versions?
   Marginal versions?
-->

### Identification assumptions:

- $A \indep Y_{a,m} \mid W$
- $M \indep Y_{a,m} \mid W, A, Z$
- $A \indep M_a \mid W$
- and positivity assumptions.

Under these assumptions, the population interventional direct and indirect
effect is identified:
\begin{align*}
  \E &(Y_{a, G_{a'}}) = \\
     & \E\left[\color{Purple}{\E\left\{\color{Goldenrod}{\sum_z}
      \color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=a, Z=z, M, W)}
      \color{Goldenrod}{\P(Z=z \mid A=a, W)}\mid A=a', W\right\}} \right]
\end{align*}

- Let's dissect this formula in `R`:
  ```{webr-r}
  n <- 1e6
  w <- rnorm(n)
  a <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
  z <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5 + 0.2 * a)
  m <- rnorm(n, w + a - z)
  y <- rnorm(n, w + a + z + m)
  ```

- Let us compute $\E(Y_{1, G_0})$ (so that $a = 1$, and $a'=0$).
- First, fit a regression model for the outcome, and compute
  $\color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=a, Z=z, M, W)}$ for all values of $z$
  ```{webr-r}
  lm_y <- lm(y ~ m + a + z + w)
  pred_a1z0 <- predict(lm_y, newdata = data.frame(m = m, a = 1, z = 0, w = w))
  pred_a1z1 <- predict(lm_y, newdata = data.frame(m = m, a = 1, z = 1, w = w))
  ```

- Now we fit the true model for $Z \mid A, W$ and get the conditional
  probability that $Z=1$ fixing $A=1$
  ```{webr-r}
  prob_z <- lm(z ~ a)
  pred_z <- predict(prob_z, newdata = data.frame(a = 1))
  ```

- Now we compute the following pseudo-outcome:
  $\color{Goldenrod}{\sum_z}\color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=a, Z=z, M, W)}
   \color{Goldenrod}{\P(Z=z \mid A=a, w)}$
  ```{webr-r}
  pseudo_out <- pred_a1z0 * (1 - pred_z) + pred_a1z1 * pred_z
  ```

- Now we regress this pseudo-outcome on $A,W$, and compute the predictions
  setting $A=0$, that is, \[\color{Purple}{\E\left\{\color{Goldenrod}{\sum_z}
  \color{ForestGreen}{\E(Y \mid A=a, Z=z, M, W)}
  \color{Goldenrod}{\P(Z=z \mid A=a, w)}\mid A=a', W\right\}}\]
  ```{webr-r}
  fit_pseudo <- lm(pseudo_out ~ a + w)
  pred_pseudo <- predict(fit_pseudo, data.frame(a = 0, w = w))
  ```

- And finally, just average those predictions!
  ```{webr-r}
  ## Mean(Y(1, G(0)))
  mean(pred_pseudo)
  ```

- This was for $(a,a')=(1,0)$. Can do the same with $(a,a')=(1,1)$, and
  $(a,a')=(0,0)$ to obtain an effect decomposition

  \begin{equation*}
    \E[Y_{1,G_1} - Y_{0,G_0}] = \underbrace{\E[Y_{\color{red}{1},
      \color{blue}{G_1}} -
      Y_{\color{red}{1},
      \color{blue}{G_0}}]}_{\text{interventional indirect effect}} +
      \underbrace{\E[Y_{\color{blue}{1},\color{red}{G_0}} -
      Y_{\color{blue}{0},
      \color{red}{G_0}}]}_{\text{interventional direct effect}}
  \end{equation*}

### Is this the estimand I want?

- Makes sense to intervene on $A$ but not directly on $M$.
- Goal is to understand a descriptive type of mediation.
- Okay with the assumptions!

### But, there is an important limitation of interventional effects

@miles2022causal recently uncovered an important limitation of these effects,
which can be described as follows. The sharp mediational hull hypothesis can be
defined as

$$
  H_0:Y(a, M(a')) = Y(a, M(a^\star));\text{ for all }a, a', a^\star \ .
$$

The problem is that interventional effects are not guaranteed to be null when
the sharp mediational hypothesis is true.

This could present a problem in practice if some subgroup of the population has
a relationship between $A$ and $M$, but not between $M$ and $Y$. Then, another
distinct subgroup of the population has a relationship between $M$ and $Y$ but
not between $A$ and $M$.  In such a scenario, the interventional indirect effect
would be nonzero, but there would be no one person in the population whose
effect of $A$ on $Y$ would be mediated by $M$.

<!--
One counterexample involves creating an NPSEM with independent errors,
$W=\emptyset$, and an exogenous binary variable $U_Z$ such that $M(a)
= M(a')$ in the event $U_Z=1$ and $Y(a,m') = Y(a,m)$ in the event
$U_Z=0$ for all $a$, $a'$, and $m$, such that there is no causal
influence of $A$ on $Y$ operating through $M$. It is easy to see that
the randomized interventional indirect effect in this example equals

\[\sum_{z,m} E(Y\mid m, z,a) P(Z=z\mid a)[P(M=m\mid a)-P(M=m\mid
a')],\]

which is generally not null, and would only be null if $U_Z$
was observed and conditioned upon in all the above quantities.
