# Additional topics of interest

The literature on mediation analysis has grown considerably in the last few
decades and there are now many novel methods to tackle important questions with
complex data structures. While we are unable to cover all these interesting
methods in this workshop, here we provide a few references for further reading.

This list is not meant to be comprehensive, just some of our own work and some
work by others that we know and consider interesting.

## Mediation with multiple mediators and multiple intermediate confounders

Note that the [`medoutcon` `R` package](https://github.com/nhejazi/medoutcon)
works for multiple mediators but is limited to settings with only a single,
binary intermediate confounder. If your data scenario includes multiple
mediators *and* *multiple* intermediate confounders, you should consider using
the [`HDmediation` `R` package](https://github.com/nt-williams/HDmediation)
instead.
