    "text": "About this workshop\nCausal mediation analysis can provide a mechanistic understanding of how an exposure impacts an outcome, a central goal in epidemiology and health sciences. However, rapid methodologic developments coupled with few formal courses presents challenges to implementation. Beginning with an overview of classical direct and indirect effects, this workshop will present recent advances that overcome limitations of previous methods, allowing for: (i) continuous exposures, (ii) multiple, non-independent mediators, and (iii) effects identifiable in the presence of intermediate confounders affected by exposure. Emphasis will be placed on flexible, stochastic and interventional direct and indirect effects, highlighting how these may be applied to answer substantive epidemiological questions from real-world studies. Multiply robust, nonparametric estimators of these causal effects, and free and open source R packages (medshift and medoutcon) for their application, will be introduced.\nTo ensure translation to real-world data analysis, this workshop will incorporate hands-on R programming exercises to allow participants practice in implementing the statistical tools presented. It is recommended that participants have working knowledge of the basic notions of causal inference, including counterfactuals and identification (linking the causal effect to a parameter estimable from the observed data distribution). Familiarity with the R programming language is also recommended.",

My research focuses on the development of non-parametric statistical methods for causal inference from observational and randomized studies with complex datasets, using machine learning. This includes but is not limited to mediation analysis, methods for continuous exposures, longitudinal data including survival analysis, and efficiency guarantees with covariate adjustment in randomized trials. I am also interested in general semi-parametric theory, machine learning, and high-dimensional data.\nNima Hejazi\nI am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My research interests blend causal inference, machine learning, non- and semi-parametric inference, and computational statistics, with areas of recent emphasis having included causal mediation analysis, estimation under outcome-dependent sampling, causal inference with continuous-valued or ordinal treatments, and sieve methods for machine learning-based estimation in causal inference. My methodological work is motivated by scientific problems arising in clinical trials and observational studies of infectious diseases and infectious disease epidemiology. I am also passionate about statistical computing and programming, and the design of open source software tools for reproducible statistical data science.\nKara Rudolph\nI am an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology in the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. My research interests are in developing and applying causal inference methods to understand social and contextual influences on mental health, substance use, and violence in disadvantaged, urban areas of the United States. My current work focuses on developing methods for transportability and mediation, and subsequently applying those methods to understand how aspects of the school and peer environments mediate relationships between neighborhood factors and adolescent drug use across populations. More generally, my work on generalizing/transporting findings from study samples to target populations and identifying subpopulations most likely to benefit from interventions contributes to efforts to optimally target available policy and program resources.",

If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.\nTo check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo(), which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on the CRAN website and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. You can check here for more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.\nIf you don’t have R and RStudio installed\n\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\nRun the .exe file that was just downloaded\nGo to the RStudio download page\n\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\nDouble click the file to install it\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\nMac OSX\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed\n\nOpen RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”.

For most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get   install r-base, and for Fedora sudo yum install R), but we don’t recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.\nGo to the RStudio download page\n\nUnder Installers select the version that matches your distribution, and install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu sudo dpkg -i   rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb at the terminal).\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\nThese setup instructions are adapted from those written for Data Carpentry: R for Data Analysis and Visualization of Ecological Data.\nVirtual environment with renv\n\nThese instructions are intended to help with setting up the included renv virtual environment, which ensures all participants are using the same exact set of R packages (and package versions). A few important notes to keep in mind:\n\nWhen R is started from the top level of this repository, renv is activated automatically. There is no further action required on your part. If renv is not installed, it will be installed automatically (as long as you have an active internet connection).\nWhile renv is active, the R session will only have access to the packages (and their dependencies) that are listed in the renv.lock file – that is, you should not expect to have access to any other R packages that may be installed elsewhere (e.g., a global package cache) on the computing system being used.\nUpon an initial attempt, renv will prompt you to install packages listed in the renv.lock file, by printing a message like the following:\n\n\nCode# - Project '~/git/ser2024_mediation_workshop' loaded. [renv 1.0.7]\n# - One or more packages recorded in the lockfile are not installed.\n# - Use `renv::status()` for more details.\n\n\nIn any such case, please call renv::status() to review the list of packages missing and to view renv’s recommendations for fixing the issue; usually, renv::restore() will be the next step necessary to install any missing packages. Note that you do not need to manually install the packages via install.packages(), remotes::install_github(), or similar, as renv will attempt do this for you.\nWhile unnecessary for the purposes of this workshop, if you’d like to learn more about hte details of how the renv virtual environment system works, the following references may be helpful:\n\nCollaborating with renv\nIntroduction to renv\n\nIn some rare cases, R packages that renv automatically tries to install as part of the renv::restore() process may fail due to missing systems-level dependencies. In such cases, a reference to the missing dependencies and system-specific instructions their installation involving, e.g., Ubuntu Linux’s apt or homebrew for macOS, will usually be displayed.",

They can help you establish, for example, if the association between treatment and outcome can be mostly explained by an association between treatment and mediator\nCausal mediation analyses, on the other hand, seek to asess causal relations. For example, they help you establish whether treatment causes the outcome because it causes the mediator.

Setting \\(A=0\\) induces another counterfactual treatment-induced confounder, denoted \\(Z_{A=0}\\).\nThe two treatment-induced counterfactual confounders, \\(Z_{A=1}\\) and \\(Z_{A=0}\\) share unmeasured common causes, \\(U_Z\\), which creates a spurious association.\nBecause \\(Z_{A=1}\\) is causally related to \\(Y_{A=1, M=m}\\), and \\(Z_{A=0}\\) is also casually related to \\(M_{A=0}\\), the path through \\(U_Z\\) means that the backdoor criterion is not met for identification of \\(Y_{A=1, M_{A=0}}\\), i.e., \\(M_{0} \\notindep Y_{A=1, m} \\mid W\\), where \\(W\\) denotes baseline covariates.\n\n\n\n\nCode\\dimendef\\prevdepth=0\n\\pgfdeclarelayer{background}\n\\pgfsetlayers{background,main}\n\\usetikzlibrary{arrows,positioning}\n\\tikzset{\n&gt;=stealth',\npunkt/.style={\nrectangle,\nrounded corners,\ndraw=black, very thick,\ntext width=6.5em,\nminimum height=2em,\ntext centered},\npil/.style={\n-&gt;,\nthick,\nshorten &lt;=2pt,\nshorten &gt;=2pt,}\n}\n\\newcommand{\\Vertex}[2]\n{\\node[minimum width=0.6cm,inner sep=0.05cm] (#2) at (#1) {$#2$};\n}\n\\newcommand{\\VertexR}[2]\n{\\node[rectangle, draw, minimum width=0.6cm,inner sep=0.05cm] (#2) at (#1) {$#2$};\n}\n\\newcommand{\\ArrowR}[3]\n{ \\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}\n\\draw[-&gt;,#3] (#1) to[bend right=30] (#2);\n\\end{pgfonlayer}\n}\n\\newcommand{\\ArrowL}[3]\n{ \\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}\n\\draw[-&gt;,#3] (#1) to[bend left=45] (#2);\n\\end{pgfonlayer}\n}\n\\newcommand{\\EdgeL}[3]\n{ \\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}\n\\draw[dashed,#3] (#1) to[bend left=45] (#2);\n\\end{pgfonlayer}\n}\n\\newcommand{\\EdgeR}[3]\n{ \\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}\n\\draw[dashed,#3] (#1) to[bend right=-45] (#2);\n\\end{pgfonlayer}\n}\n\\newcommand{\\Arrow}[3]\n{ \\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}\n\\draw[-&gt;,#3] (#1) -- +(#2);\n\\end{pgfonlayer}\n}\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n  \\Vertex{0, 1}{Z_0}\n  \\Vertex{0, -1}{Z_1}\n  \\Vertex{-2, 0}{U_Z}\n  \\Vertex{2, 1}{M_0}\n  \\Vertex{4, -1}{Y_{1, m}}\n  \\Arrow{Z_0}{M_0}{black}\n  \\Arrow{Z_1}{Y_{1, m}}{black}\n  \\Arrow{U_Z}{Z_0}{black}\n  \\Arrow{U_Z}{Z_1}{black}\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n\n\nParallel worlds model of the scenario considered\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever:\n\nWe can actually actually identify the NIE/NDE in the above setting if we are willing to invoke monotonicity between a treatment and one or more binary treatment-induced confounders (Tchetgen Tchetgen and VanderWeele 2014).\nAssuming monotonicity is also sometimes referred to as assuming “no defiers” – in other words, assuming that there are no individuals who would do the opposite of the encouragement.\nMonotonicity may seem like a restrictive assumption, but may be reasonable in some common scenarios (e.g., in trials where the intervention is randomized treatment assignment and the treatment-induced confounder is whether or not treatment was actually taken – in this setting, we may feel comfortable assuming that there are no “defiers”, frequently assumed when using IVs to identify causal effects)\n\n\nTchetgen Tchetgen, Eric J, and Tyler J VanderWeele. 2014. “On Identification of Natural Direct Effects When a Confounder of the Mediator Is Directly Affected by Exposure.” Epidemiology 25 (2): 282.\nNote: CDEs are still identified in this setting.

(2020), implements one-step and TML estimators of both the natural and interventional (in)direct effects.\nBoth types of estimators are capable of accommodating flexible modeling strategies (e.g., ensemble machine learning) for the initial estimation of nuisance parameters.\nThe medoutcon R package uses cross-validation in initial estimation: this results in cross-validated (or “cross-fitted”) one-step and TML estimators (Klaassen 1987; Zheng and van der Laan 2011; Chernozhukov et al. 2018), which exhibit greater robustness than their non-sample-splitting analogs.\nTo this end, medoutcon integrates with the sl3 R package (Coyle et al. 2022), which is extensively documented in this book chapter (Phillips 2022; van der Laan et al. 2022).\n\nDı́az, Iván, Nima S Hejazi, Kara E Rudolph, and Mark J van der Laan. 2020. “Non-Parametric Efficient Causal Mediation with Intermediate Confounders.” Biometrika. https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asaa085.\n\nKlaassen, Chris AJ. 1987. “Consistent Estimation of the Influence Function of Locally Asymptotically Linear Estimators.” The Annals of Statistics, 1548–62.\n\nZheng, Wenjing, and Mark J van der Laan. 2011. “Cross-Validated Targeted Minimum-Loss-Based Estimation.” In Targeted Learning, 459–74.

Recall that these are\n\n\n\\(g(a\\mid w)\\), which denotes \\(\\P(A=a \\mid W=w)\\)\n\n\n\\(h(a\\mid m, w)\\), which denotes \\(\\P(A=a \\mid M=m, W=w)\\)\n\n\n\\(b(a, m, w)\\), which denotes \\(\\E(Y \\mid A=a, M=m, W=w)\\)\n\n\n\nWhile we recommend the use of Super Learning, we opt to instead estimate all nuisance parameters with Lasso regression below (to save computational time).\n\nNow, let’s use the medoutcon() function to estimate the natural direct effect:\n\nCode# compute one-step estimate of the natural direct effect\nnde_onestep &lt;- medoutcon(\n  W = weight_behavior[, c(\"age\", \"sex\", \"race\", \"tvhours\")],\n  A = (as.numeric(weight_behavior$sports) - 1),\n  Z = NULL,\n  M = weight_behavior[, c(\"snack\", \"exercises\", \"overweigh\")],\n  Y = weight_behavior$bmi,\n  g_learners = lasso_lrnr,\n  h_learners = lasso_lrnr,\n  b_learners = lasso_lrnr,\n  effect = \"direct\",\n  estimator = \"onestep\",\n  estimator_args = list(cv_folds = 5)\n)\nsummary(nde_onestep)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  lwr_ci param_est upr_ci var_est  eif_mean estimator param         \n   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 -0.388     0.249  0.886   0.106 -6.03e-16 onestep   direct_natural\n\n\n\nWe can similarly call medoutcon() to estimate the natural indirect effect:\n\n\nCode# compute one-step estimate of the natural indirect effect\nnie_onestep &lt;- medoutcon(\n  W = weight_behavior[, c(\"age\", \"sex\", \"race\", \"tvhours\")],\n  A = (as.numeric(weight_behavior$sports) - 1),\n  Z = NULL,\n  M = weight_behavior[, c(\"snack\", \"exercises\", \"overweigh\")],\n  Y = weight_behavior$bmi,\n  g_learners = lasso_lrnr,\n  h_learners = lasso_lrnr,\n  b_learners = lasso_lrnr,\n  effect = \"indirect\",\n  estimator = \"onestep\",\n  estimator_args = list(cv_folds = 5)\n)\nsummary(nie_onestep)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  lwr_ci param_est upr_ci var_est eif_mean estimator param           \n   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;           \n1  0.507      1.07   1.63  0.0823 3.10e-15 onestep   indirect_natural\n\n\n\nFrom the above, we can conclude that the effect of participation on a sports team on BMI is primarily mediated by the variables snack, exercises, and overweigh, as the natural indirect effect is several times larger than the natural direct effect.\nNote that we could have instead used the TML estimators, which have improved finite-sample performance, instead of the one-step estimators. Doing this is as simple as setting the estimator = \"tmle\" in the relevant argument.\n\n6.1.4 Interventional (in)direct effects\nSince our knowledge of the system under study is incomplete, we might worry that one (or more) of the measured variables are not mediators, but, in fact, intermediate confounders affected by treatment. While the natural (in)direct effects are not identified in this setting, their interventional (in)direct counterparts are, as we saw in an earlier section. Recall that both types of effects are defined by static interventions on the treatment. The interventional effects are distinguished by their use of a stochastic intervention on the mediator to aid in their identification.\n\nCode\\dimendef\\prevdepth=0\n\\pgfdeclarelayer{background}\n\\pgfsetlayers{background,main}\n\\usetikzlibrary{arrows,positioning}\n\\tikzset{\n&gt;=stealth',\npunkt/.style={\nrectangle,\nrounded corners,\ndraw=black, very thick,\ntext width=6.5em,\nminimum height=2em,\ntext centered},\npil/.style={\n-&gt;,\nthick,\nshorten &lt;=2pt,\nshorten &gt;=2pt,}\n}\n\\newcommand{\\Vertex}[2]\n{\\node[minimum width=0.6cm,inner sep=0.05cm] (#2) at (#1) {$#2$};\n}\n\\newcommand{\\VertexR}[2]\n{\\node[rectangle, draw, minimum width=0.6cm,inner sep=0.05cm] (#2) at (#1) {$#2$};\n}\n\\newcommand{\\ArrowR}[3]\n{ \\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}\n\\draw[-&gt;,#3] (#1) to[bend right=30] (#2);\n\\end{pgfonlayer}\n}\n\\newcommand{\\ArrowL}[3]\n{ \\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}\n\\draw[-&gt;,#3] (#1) to[bend left=45] (#2);\n\\end{pgfonlayer}\n}\n\\newcommand{\\EdgeL}[3]\n{ \\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}\n\\draw[dashed,#3] (#1) to[bend right=-45] (#2);\n\\end{pgfonlayer}\n}\n\\newcommand{\\Arrow}[3]\n{ \\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}\n\\draw[-&gt;,#3] (#1) -- +(#2);\n\\end{pgfonlayer}\n}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n  \\Vertex{0, -1}{Z}\n  \\Vertex{-4, 0}{W}\n  \\Vertex{0, 0}{M}\n  \\Vertex{-2, 0}{A}\n  \\Vertex{2, 0}{Y}\n  \\ArrowR{W}{Z}{black}\n  \\Arrow{Z}{M}{black}\n  \\Arrow{W}{A}{black}\n  \\Arrow{A}{M}{black}\n  \\Arrow{M}{Y}{black}\n  \\Arrow{A}{Z}{black}\n  \\Arrow{Z}{Y}{black}\n  \\ArrowL{W}{Y}{black}\n  \\ArrowL{A}{Y}{black}\n  \\ArrowL{W}{M}{black}\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n\n\nDirected acyclic graph under intermediate confounders of the mediator-outcome relation affected by treatment\n\n\n\nRecall that the interventional (in)direct effects are defined via the decomposition:\n\\[\n  \\E[Y_{1,G_1} - Y_{0,G_0}] =\n    \\underbrace{\\E[Y_{\\color{red}{1},\\color{blue}{G_1}} -\n    Y_{\\color{red}{1},\\color{blue}{G_0}}]}_{\\text{interventional indirect effect}} +\n    \\underbrace{\\E[Y_{\\color{blue}{1},\\color{red}{G_0}} -\n    Y_{\\color{blue}{0},\\color{red}{G_0}}]}_{\\text{interventional direct effect}}\n\\]\n\nIn our data example, we’ll consider the eating of snacks as a potential intermediate confounder, since one might reasonably hypothesize that participation on a sports team might subsequently affect snacking, which then could affect mediators like the amount of exercises and overweight status.\nThe interventional direct and indirect effects may also be easily estimated with the medoutcon R package (Hejazi, Dı́az, and Rudolph 2022; Hejazi, Rudolph, and Dı́az 2022).\nJust as for the natural (in)direct effects, medoutcon implements cross-validated one-step and TML estimators of the interventional effects.\n\nHejazi, Nima S, Iván Dı́az, and Kara E Rudolph. 2022. “medoutcon: Efficient Natural and Interventional Causal Mediation Analysis.” https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5809519.\n\nHejazi, Nima S, Kara E Rudolph, and Iván Dı́az. 2022. “medoutcon: Nonparametric Efficient Causal Mediation Analysis with Machine Learning in R.” Journal of Open Source Software. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03979.\n\n6.1.5 Efficient estimation of the interventional (in)direct effects\n\n\nEstimation of these effects is more complex, so a few additional nuisance parameters arise when expressing the (more general) EIF for these effects:\n\n\n\\(q(z \\mid a, w)\\), the conditional density of the intermediate confounders, conditional only on treatment and baseline covariates;\n\n\\(r(z \\mid a, m, w)\\), the conditional density of the intermediate confounders, conditional on mediators, treatment, and baseline covariates.\n\n\nTo estimate the interventional effects, we only need to set the argument Z of medoutcon to a value other than NULL.\nNote that the implementation in medoutcon is currently limited to settings with only binary intermediate confounders, i.e., \\(Z \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\).\n\nLet’s use medoutcon() to estimate the interventional direct effect:\n\nCode# compute one-step estimate of the interventional direct effect\ninterv_de_onestep &lt;- medoutcon(\n  W = weight_behavior[, c(\"age\", \"sex\", \"race\", \"tvhours\")],\n  A = (as.numeric(weight_behavior$sports) - 1),\n  Z = (as.numeric(weight_behavior$snack) - 1),\n  M = weight_behavior[, c(\"exercises\", \"overweigh\")],\n  Y = weight_behavior$bmi,\n  g_learners = lasso_lrnr,\n  h_learners = lasso_lrnr,\n  b_learners = lasso_lrnr,\n  effect = \"direct\",\n  estimator = \"onestep\",\n  estimator_args = list(cv_folds = 5)\n)\nsummary(interv_de_onestep)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  lwr_ci param_est upr_ci var_est  eif_mean estimator param                \n   &lt;dbl&gt;

That is, assume the data are \\(O=(W, A_1, Z_1, M_1, L_1, A_2,\nZ_2, M_2, Y)\\).\nIdentification can be based on the following procedure. First, for each value \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) of the mediator, compute outcome regressions as follows:\n\nRegress \\(Y\\) on \\(W, A_1, Z_1, M_1, L_1, A_2, Z_2, M_2\\). Use this regression to predict the outcome had the mediator been set to \\(M_2=m_2\\).

Use this regression to predict the outcome had the treatment \\(A_2\\) been set to \\(d(A_2, H_2)\\). Let \\(\\tilde Y_2^d(m_2)\\) denote this prediction.\nRegress \\(\\tilde Y_2(m_2, d_2)\\) on \\(W, A_1, Z_1, M_1\\). Use this regression to predict the outcome had the mediator been set to \\(M_1=m_1\\). Let \\(\\tilde Y_1(m_1, m_2)\\) denote this prediction.\nRegress \\(\\tilde Y_1(m_1, m_2)\\) on \\(W, A_1\\). Use this regression to predict the outcome had the treatment \\(A_1\\) been set to \\(d(A_1, H_1)\\). Let \\(\\tilde Y_1^d(m_1, m_2)\\) denote this prediction.\n\nThen, for each value \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) of the mediator, compute the mediator distribution as follows:\n\nRegress the binary variable \\(I(M_2=m_2)\\) on \\(W, A_1, Z_1, M_1, L_1, A_2\\). Use this model to predict the probability of \\(M_2=m_2\\) under an intervention that sets \\(A_2\\) to \\(d(A_2, H_2)\\). Let this predicted probability be denoted with \\(P(m_2)\\).\nRegress the binary variable \\(I(M_1=m_1)P(m_2)\\) on \\(W, A_1\\). Use this model to predict under an intervention that sets \\(A_1\\) to \\(d(A_1, H_1)\\). Let this prediction be denoted with \\(P(m_1, m_2)\\).\n\nAt the end of these two sequential regression procedures, we have values \\(\\tilde Y_1^d(m_1, m_2)\\) and \\(P(m_1, m_2)\\) for each value of the mediator \\((m_1, m_2)\\). Then, under identification assumptions, we have:\n\\[\n  \\E[Y(d, G(d)) = \\sum_{m_1, m_2}\\tilde Y_1^d(m_1, m_2)P(m_1, m_2) \\ .\n\\]",

    "text": "9.3 Definition of stochastic effects\nThere are two possible ways of defining stochastic effects:\n\nConsider the effect of an intervention where the exposure is drawn from a distribution\n\nFor example incremental propensity score interventions\n\n\nConsider the effect of an intervention where the post-intervention exposure is a function of the actually received exposure\n\nFor example modified treatment policies\n\n\nIn both cases \\(A \\mid W\\) is a non-deterministic intervention, thus the name stochastic intervention\n\n\n\n9.3.1 Example: incremental propensity score interventions (IPSI) (Kennedy 2018)\n\n\nKennedy, Edward H. 2018. “Nonparametric Causal Effects Based on Incremental Propensity Score Interventions.” Journal of the American Statistical Association, no. just-accepted.\nDefinition of the intervention\n\nAssume \\(A\\) is binary, and \\(\\P(A=1\\mid W=w) = g(1\\mid w)\\) is the propensity score\nConsider an intervention in which each individual receives the intervention with probability \\(g_\\delta(1\\mid w)\\), equal to \\[\\begin{equation*}\n  g_\\delta(1\\mid w)=\\frac{\\delta g(1\\mid w)}{\\delta g(1\\mid w) +\n  1 - g(1\\mid w)}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\n\ne.g., draw the post-intervention exposure from a Bernoulli variable with probability \\(g_\\delta(1\\mid w)\\)\n\nThe value \\(\\delta\\) is user given\nLet \\(A_\\delta\\) denote the post-intervention exposure distribution\nSome algebra shows that \\(\\delta\\) is an odds ratio comparing the pre- and post-intervention exposure distributions \\[\\begin{equation*}\n  \\delta = \\frac{\\text{odds}(A_\\delta = 1\\mid W=w)}\n  {\\text{odds}(A = 1\\mid W=w)}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\n\nInterpretation: what would happen in a world where the odds of receiving treatment is increased by \\(\\delta\\)\n\nLet \\(Y_{A_\\delta}\\) denote the outcome in this hypothetical world\n\n9.3.1.1 Illustrative application for IPSIs\n\nConsider the effect of participation in sports on children’s BMI\nMediation through snacking, exercising, etc.\nIntervention: for each individual, increase the odds of participating in sports by \\(\\delta=2\\)\n\nThe post-intervention exposure is a draw \\(A_\\delta\\) from a Bernoulli distribution with probability \\(g_\\delta(1\\mid w)\\)\n\nExample: modified treatment policies (MTP) (Dı́az and Hejazi 2020)\n\n\nDı́az, Iván, and Nima S Hejazi. 2020. “Causal Mediation Analysis for Stochastic Interventions.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology) 82 (3): 661–83.\nDefinition of the intervention\n\nConsider a continuous exposure \\(A\\) taking values in the real numbers\nConsider an intervention that assigns exposure as \\(A_\\delta = A - \\delta\\)\n\nExample: \\(A\\) is pollution measured as \\(PM_{2.5}\\) and you are interested in an intervention that reduces \\(PM_{2.5}\\) concentration by some amount \\(\\delta\\)\n\n\n9.3.2 Mediation analysis for stochastic interventions\n\nThe total effect of an IPSI can be computed as a contrast of the outcome under intervention vs no intervention: \\[\\begin{equation*}\n  \\psi = \\E[Y_{A_\\delta} - Y]\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nRecall the NPSEM \\[\\begin{align*}\n  W & = f_W(U_W)\\\\\n  A & = f_A(W, U_A)\\\\\n  M & = f_M(W, A, U_M)\\\\\n  Y & = f_Y(W, A, M, U_Y)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFrom this we have \\[\\begin{align*}\nM_{A_\\delta} & = f_M(W, A_\\delta, U_M)\\\\\nY_{A_\\delta} & = f_Y(W, A_\\delta, M_{A_\\delta}, U_Y)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThus, we have \\(Y_{A_\\delta} = Y_{A_\\delta, M_{A_\\delta}}\\) and \\(Y =\nY_{A,M_{A}}\\)\nLet us introduce the counterfactual \\(Y_{A_\\delta, M}\\), interpreted as the outcome observed in a world where the intervention on \\(A\\) is performed but the mediator is fixed at the value it would have taken under no intervention: [Y_{A_, M} = f_Y(W, A_, M, U_Y)]\nThen we can decompose the total effect into: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y&_{A_\\delta,M_{A_\\delta}} - Y_{A,M_A}] = \\\\\n  &\\underbrace{\\E[Y_{\\color{red}{A_\\delta},\\color{blue}{M_{A_\\delta}}} -\n    Y_{\\color{red}{A_\\delta},\\color{blue}{M}}]}_{\\text{stochastic natural\n      indirect effect}} +\n    \\underbrace{\\E[Y_{\\color{blue}{A_\\delta},\\color{red}{M}} -\n    Y_{\\color{blue}{A},\\color{red}{M}}]}_{\\text{stochastic natural direct\n      effect}}\n\\end{align*}\\]",
